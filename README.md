<br/><br/><p>Lir is installed by running ./wizard for a graphical setup. Require Python 3.x to run. Right now this is still in early development. The easiest way to send command is using telnet. Run ./server and use telnet with localhost or from another device. The default port is 8090. Settings can be found in ~/.lir/main.ini</p>
