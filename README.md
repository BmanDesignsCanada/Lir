# Lir
Linux Interactive Requests

Lir is installed by either running setup.py for a cli setup or wizard.py for a graphical setup. Both files require Python 3.x to run.

Right now this is still in early development. The easiest way to send command is using telnet. Run server.py with Python 3.x and using telnet with localhost or from another device. The default port is 8090.

Settings can be found in ~/.lir/main.ini
